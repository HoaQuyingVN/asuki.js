To-do can work! This is a package designed to interact with FB.API. It provides two classes for your bot:

- `API`: Used to interact with the FB API.
- `Web`: Helps you create classes for your bot dashboard, allowing you to define custom commands, set prefixes, enable web chat functionality, and handle various events such as logging, notifications, and error restrictions.

Your bot can also add extensions for Facebook using the Facension API, such as the Sound from Emoji extension provided by `@manyong/soundemoji`.

Get started now and make your bot amazing!
